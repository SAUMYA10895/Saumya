    <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex and serious developmental disorder that significantly impairs an individual's ability to communicate and interact with others. Unlike a typical disease, ASD is a lifelong condition that varies widely in severity and manifests through a broad range of symptoms. These symptoms include challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, and difficulties with both speech and nonverbal communication.</p>  
    <p>People with autism tend to be very interested in certain subjects, such as animals, art, or math. Additionally, they could possess unusual skills or aptitudes, including having a superb memory or being exceptionally adept at concentrating on things they enjoy. 
     Autism spectrum disorders can also cause differences in sensory sensations. It's possible that they will react differently to light, music, touch, or taste.

   <p> Dr. Leo Canner has provided valuable insights into the nature of autism, indicating that a small percentage of individuals exhibit autistic traits from birthâ€”typically around 2 to 3 percent. According to Dr. Canner, these traits can diminish over time with proper social interaction and engagement, such as talking to and playing with children. This early interaction is crucial in helping children develop essential communication and social skills. But if these students were not given proper attention with time then the percentage of autism can increase to 90 to 95 percent also. </p>
